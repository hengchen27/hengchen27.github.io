                            This piece was created for an assignment which is basically a JavaScript Game using CreateJS
                            for Special Topic I Class. This game has the following features: (1) different game levels
                            with different patterns of bricks to break (2) different types of bricks (i.e. a different
                            colour bricks that takes more than one hit to break and change colour to show breaking
                            progress) (3) special bricks that drop power ups that your paddle can catch for upgrades and
                            one of these power-ups must be a second ball (4) a timer for each level so bricks have to be
                            broken within the time frame (5) High score functionality stored in local storage (6) Animation
                            with SpriteSheet, sound files for game events, both keyboard and mouse controls, and show
                            progress bar when loading the game. <br/>

                    The highlight of this JavaScript game application is to use CreateJS, which is to create animations
                    (SpriteSheet) and interactive content（ for example SoundJS and PreloadJS） on our HTML5 pages in
                    combination with basics of HTML5 Canvas and User Input by Keyboard and Mouse. Besides. As for game
                    design itself, it is a dramatically beefed up version of simple break out game that was learned and
                    built through a tutorial.

                        Following the requirements(features) of this assignment, I started with designing the game
                        levels, brick patterns and brick colors logic as well as a countdown timer. After that, I added
                        animations by using Sprite Sheet for showing drop-drown items when hitting special bricks with
                        its logic. In addition to that, I added several sound files and a game loading progress bar with
                        CreateJS. The whole process is done step by step by following the requirements of an advanced
                        version of breakout game.

                        like HTML/CSS/JavaScript and learned how to use canvas/ add animations, and incorporate other
                        user input by using keyboard and mouse controls, most importantly, I got to understand how to
                        make use of CreateJS for animations and interactive contents. The biggest challenges are
                        preparing Sprite Sheet and designing the animation parts for the game.

                        from the server. Users are able to download books from the library and store them locally for
                        reading anywhere. As for the layout of the book reader, there are two views-the first view gives
                        the user a list of books that are available in the system, and the second is the reading view
                        containing a table of contents and a reading pane.<br/>

                <p>The highlight of this assignment is about “caching”, and in this case we are storing 3 main types of

                    specific goals are displayed as below:</p>

                    The process started by identifying the basic folder structure, the reader, the manifest and books
                    folder. I also created a readerHelper class for methods dealing with things like updating the book
                    list on the page, downloading books, removing books, creating book list and updating book content etc.
                    There is also a reader.js for creating an object of  the readerHelper class and defining book class
                    and database object to store all the books as well as a timer for continuously pulling data.

                            This piece was created for the final assignment for Web Application Programming II. The main
                            structure was similar and taken from the Weather Progressive Web App (PWA) that I previously created.
                            For this application, the data was taken from my NSCC Course Map API (ASP.Net Core Web API
                            completed in previous assignment) that has been deployed on Microsoft Azure. In this app,
                            the home page will provide users a list of IT Courses at NSCC and will display course details
                            when clicking/tapping on selected one. This app also has employed caching strategies for
                            caching the app shell and data from the API. <br/>

                        I started building this application by modifying the files of the weather WAP and adding details
                        page and its JavaScript file. The biggest part of the work is to successfully call the course map
                        api (I added a new CORS policy in the program.cs of my api project to make it work). Apart from
                        getting all the required data, another challenge is the details page which requires you get a new
                        url for the page as well as getting the CourseID for each selected course. The caching strategy
                        of this application doesn’t have too much change though.

                        (the NSCC Course Map API) with the client I created in this assignment. In addition to that,
                        the course data obtained from API are displayed in an appropriate and clear way on two pages,

                            This piece was created for an assignment for my Full stack Programming class. This application
                            allows user to enter keyword in search of tv shows (api data from TV Maze), and the search
                            result will show 10 records that matches the user’s search. When the user clicks on any tv
                            show from the list, more details of this tv show will be displayed on the right of the panel,
                            and there is a cast list button which will display the cast information when clicked.
                            This will be kept open when the user switches between different tv shows until he/she tries a new search.
                            The screenshot on the right shows the screen when user starts a research and clicks on one of the tv shows.

                        <li>The tv show details section displays the image for the selected show when available. If an image is not available, a generic image informing the end-user that an image is not available should be displayed. </li>
                        <li> It initially displays a button that prompts the user to click in order to retrieve cast data from the API about the currently selected show. Once clicked, the component should then display either a list if cast results, or if no results are returned, a message stating so. As for Cast list data, once loaded for a selected show, should not have to be reloaded until such a time as a new search is performed and a new set of search results is returned. </li>

                        The React Application was completed by taking many steps, and the first and most important step
                        was to build all the required components and determine the parent-child relationships of them.
                        After that, I followed the instructions for each component to display the required data called from TV Maze API .

                        This is the first React Application I built after learning ReactJS. It has reflected all the key
                        concepts in React like props, state, JSX, components and lifecycle methods. It has used the data
                        from TVMaze API in an informative and clear way that will be a very useful tv show search tool for users.

                            This sample application is what I was trying to build in studying a Lynda tutorial called “React Native:
                            Building Mobile Apps” during my gap analysis study period. However, there are some building errors
                            that I have encountered during the process because of compatibility issues of React Native verisons
                            and its packages, which was the biggest blocker in the study. But I still tried my best to get familiar with
                            react native installation/building procedure as well as undestand the syntax and usage of different packages from  the code
                            itself, which is the biggest takeaway of the study. <br><br>
                            Other learning resources include
                            official documentation of React Native (https://facebook.github.io/react-native) and other
                            online articles and documents. <br/><br/>
                            As for this react-native application itself, it is designed as a meal discovery app, where
                            logged in users can take a picture of meal, review and share it with other users, so other
                            users can know how good the dish is that you posted. In this app, it has included other
                            technologies and libraries like React Native, Firebase(for storage and authentication),
                            NativeBase (UI component library for RN),MobX (state management library). Like many other
                            mobile apps, the app in the tutorial has more than one screen. In order to navigate between
                            multiple screens, it uses a navigator from react-navigation library for this purpose.
                            Also, it uses mobX-react to connect screen with configuration store, how it works?  it uses
                            a provider to provide screen components with store in app.js. And uses inject that takes that
                            store and inject it into our class in the screen.
                            The screenshot on the right shows two main screens the user will see, that is, login screen and
                            match screen.

                    To build a meal discovery and review application containing four different screens, which should
                    incorporate other technologies like using firebase for storage and authentication, using native base
                    for screens’ styling as well as MobX for state management.

                        I started building this application from installing and running a react-native app for IOS
                        (Installing all dependencies and setting up on macOS), after that I followed the instructions
                        on building different screens, navigator, stores, images and other components. The biggest
                        challenge was to learn the usage of some libraries like MobX and Native Base.

                        1. Familiarity with the basic concepts in React is really important and helps to learn and understand React Native.

                    <p>
                        2. Read more React Native documentations before starting online tutorials is necessary and I should have chosen a course more for beginners.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. I should have checked the updates in the new version of react native first when creating a project.
